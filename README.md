# FuelCO2 Predictor

A simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size.

## Overview

This project uses real-world vehicle fuel consumption data to train a linear regression model. The model predicts the amount of CO2 emissions produced by a vehicle given its engine size.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Model training using scikit-learn's LinearRegression
- Model evaluation with RÂ² score
- Visualization of training data and regression line

## Requirements

Make sure you have these Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
